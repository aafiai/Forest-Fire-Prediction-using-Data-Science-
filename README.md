# Forest-Fire-Prediction-using-Data-Science-
Implemented and evaluated various data science algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, K-means Clustering, and Logistic Regression, to predict forest fires in Portugal. Analyzed algorithm performance to determine which methods provided the most accurate and precise results, contributing to improved predictive insights for forest fire management.


This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict and analyze forest fire occurrences using environmental data. The dataset includes features such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. By employing classification and clustering techniques, the system identifies fire-prone areas and predicts the likelihood of fires, assisting in proactive risk management.

# Key Features:

Data Preprocessing:

Transforms the forest fire dataset into a binary classification problem, categorizing areas as either "burned" or "not burned."
Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets for model evaluation.
Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression: Predicts fire occurrences and evaluates accuracy.
Random Forest Classifier: Utilizes ensemble learning to improve prediction reliability.
Naive Bayes: Provides probabilistic predictions for fire classification.
K-Means Clustering: Groups areas based on fire risk and visualizes results using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
Accuracy Assessment:

Compares the performance of models using accuracy scores to determine the most effective algorithm.
Visualization:

Uses PCA to reduce dimensionality for K-Means clustering and visualizes decision boundaries for risk zones.
User Insights:

Identifies key factors contributing to forest fires, helping authorities plan fire prevention strategies.

# Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
Matplotlib for visualizations

# Applications:
This project is ideal for environmental agencies and disaster management teams to predict forest fires, allocate resources effectively, and implement preventive measures.
